## Causal Validation Gate

46 executable rules across 7 pipeline stages. Each rule is simultaneously:
executable test, mathematical claim, scientific reference, falsifiability criterion.

| Stage | Rules | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| simulate | 11 | Field finiteness, membrane bounds, CFL stability, occupancy conservation |
| extract | 7 | Embedding finiteness, version contract, fractal R² quality |
| detect | 8 | Score bounds, label validity, pathological causality |
| forecast | 7 | Horizon check, uncertainty envelope, error monotonicity |
| compare | 6 | Distance non-negative, cosine bounds, topology consistency |
| cross-stage | 5 | Regime-label coherence, neuromod implications |
| perturbation | 2 | Label/regime stability under ε-noise |

Decision semantics: `pass` → report published · `degraded` → published with warnings · `fail` → blocked

## Scientific Validation

11/11 validations against published data:

| Test | Computed | Reference | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| E_K (K+ Nernst) | −89.0 mV | −89.0 ± 5 mV | Hille (2001) |
| E_Na (Na+ Nernst) | +66.6 mV | +66.0 ± 5 mV | Hille (2001) |
| E_Ca (Ca²+ Nernst) | +101.5 mV | +102.0 ± 5 mV | Hille (2001) |
| RT/F at 37°C | 26.712 mV | 26.730 mV | Standard biophysics |
| Fractal dimension (D_box) | 1.762 ± 0.008 | 1.585 (D_mass) | Fricker et al. (2017) ¹ |
| Turing pattern | Δ = 0.002 V | > 1e-6 V | Turing (1952) |

¹ **Fractal dimension discrepancy (11%)**: MFN computes D_box (box-counting
dimension) = 1.762; Fricker et al. report D_mass (mass dimension) = 1.585 for
*Phanerochaete velutina*. The methods measure different geometric properties:
D_box counts covering boxes at each scale; D_mass measures how mass scales with
radius from the center. For branching networks, D_box ≥ D_mass is the expected
relationship (Falconer 2003, §3.3). Additionally, Fricker's measurement is on
a real organism (*P. velutina*), while MFN simulates a reaction-diffusion field
with different growth parameters. This is a methodological difference, not an
error. See `validation/numerics/fractal_dimension_analysis.py` for the
comparison study.

## Reproducibility

All results deterministic with fixed seed. SHA256 fingerprint on every artifact.
Golden hashes locked for 4 canonical profiles (baseline, gabaa_tonic, serotonergic, balanced_criticality).
