# System Optimization Summary

This summary documents the **current** optimization and integration workstreams that are already implemented in TradePulse. It is intentionally scoped to existing components—no new surface area or speculative features are introduced.

## Scope and Intent
- Capture the optimizations that are live in the codebase today.
- Highlight how they integrate across the neuro stack, thermodynamic controller, and execution utilities.
- Provide a concise reference for operators without expanding system boundaries.

## Implemented Optimization Pillars
1. **Neuro Optimization Loop**
   - Modules: `src/tradepulse/core/neuro/adaptive_calibrator.py`, `src/tradepulse/core/neuro/neuro_optimizer.py`.
   - Capabilities: simulated-annealing calibration, multi-objective balance optimizer, convergence detection, homeostatic setpoints.
   - Typical cadence: fast iteration loops (~0.1 ms/step) with momentum-based updates and patience resets to escape local optima.

2. **Thermodynamic Control Integration**
   - Bridge: NeuralTACLBridge (`tradepulse/neural_controller/integration/bridge.py`) connects the neuro controller to the TACL optimization layer.
   - Safeguards: synchrony throttling via Kuramoto order parameter, desync downscaling, deterministic fallback when the runtime TACL provider is unavailable.
   - Iteration control: generation limits are propagated from the neural controller to TACL to keep optimization bounded.

3. **Execution and Observability Optimizations**
   - Caching & batching: `IndicatorCache` in `examples/optimization_examples.py` provides adaptive polling and streaming replayer patterns for low-latency ingestion.
   - Async metrics: background batch flushing with Prometheus-friendly gauges reduces hot-path blocking.
   - Performance guardrails: optional float32/chunking paths in indicator modules preserve numerical parity while trimming memory pressure.

## Integration Coverage
- **CLI and SDK**: Optimization workflows are exposed through `tradepulse_cli optimize` and the MLSDM (Multi-Level Stochastic Decision Model) facade (`src/tradepulse/sdk/mlsdm/facade.py`), reusing the same optimization engines.
- **Telemetry**: Metrics emitters (`core/utils/metrics.py`, `tradepulse/neural_controller/telemetry/metrics.py`) track optimization duration and iteration counts for dashboards and alerts.
- **Safety**: CVaR gating and mode-aware temperature coupling (NeuralTACLBridge) keep optimization outputs within risk thresholds.

## Verification and Iteration
- Functional coverage exists in (repository-relative paths):
    - `tests/optimization/test_optimization_examples.py`
    - `tests/unit/core/neuro/test_neuro_optimizer.py`
    - `tradepulse/neural_controller/tests/test_integration.py`
- These suites validate iterator behavior, cache correctness, neuro-loop state updates, and bridge-level guardrails without expanding scope.

The current optimization stack is operational, integrated, and bounded. Future work should extend this document only when additional optimizations graduate into production pathways.
