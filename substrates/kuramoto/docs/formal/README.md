## Artifacts

### Existing Artifacts

#### 1. Free Energy Boundedness Proof
**File:** `proof_invariant.py`
**Certificate:** `INVARIANT_CERT.txt`

**Purpose:** Proves that the thermodynamic control system's free energy never grows unboundedly.

**Method:** SMT-based inductive proof using Z3 solver

**Key Property:**
```
∀ state transitions: F_{t+1} ≤ F_t + ε (ε ≤ 0.05) and any spike must decay below the originating state within a 3-step recovery window (decay=0.9, tolerance floor=1e-4)
```
Base case enforces non-negative initial free energy with capped perturbation; the inductive step asserts that the recovery mean over the three-step window (mirroring ``ThermoController._predict_recovery_window``) falls back below the originating state.

**Status:** ✅ Verified (UNSAT - no counterexample exists)

**Usage:**
```bash
python formal/proof_invariant.py              # regenerates INVARIANT_CERT.txt
pytest formal/tests/test_proof_invariant.py   # UNSAT/SAT plus tolerance property tests
```

**Assumptions (aligned with runtime TACL):**
- Non-negative initial free energy with per-step perturbations clamped to ``ε ≤ 0.05``.
- Recovery horizon of 3 steps with exponential decay ``0.9`` toward the baseline state.
- Tolerance budget mirrors ``ThermoController._monotonic_tolerance_budget``: ``max(1e-4, 0.01·max(|baseline|, |F_t|), 0.5·|ε_t|)``.
- Baseline is fixed to the pre-crisis free energy (``F0``); kill-switch/dual approval gates remain unchanged.

**Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install z3-solver
# Recommended for tests: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

#### 2. Serotonin Controller Falsification Hypotheses
**File:** `falsification_serotonin_controller_v2_2.md`

**Purpose:** Defines testable hypotheses for SerotoninController v2.2 improvements

**Hypotheses:**
1. Dynamic tonic vs static baseline (≥15% faster cooldown)
2. Desensitization vs frozen behavior (≥30% reduction in HOLD days)
3. Meta-adaptation vs static weights (≥5% Sharpe improvement)
4. Risk-regime robustness (reduced variance under perturbations)
5. Validation impact (eliminate crashes without performance degradation)

**Testing Approach:** Empirical falsification via backtesting and Monte Carlo simulation

**Status:** 🔄 Active testing in progress

## Verification Methods

### Static Analysis

#### Type Checking
```bash
mypy tradepulse/
```

**Coverage Target:** 100% for critical paths

**Current Status:** Type hints on public APIs

---

#### Linting and Style
```bash
ruff check tradepulse/
black --check tradepulse/
```

---

### Property-Based Testing

**Framework:** Hypothesis

**Example:**
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.lists(st.floats(min_value=0)))
def test_free_energy_monotonic(energy_series):
    """Property: Free energy never increases unboundedly."""
    for i in range(len(energy_series) - 1):
        delta = energy_series[i+1] - energy_series[i]
        assert delta <= EPSILON_CAP, "Energy increase exceeds cap"
```

**Coverage:** Critical invariants (position limits, data integrity, determinism)

---

### Formal Verification

#### Z3 SMT Solver
Used for mathematical proofs of system invariants.

**Current Proofs:**
1. ✅ Free energy boundedness (inductive recovery + monotone tolerance budget)
2. 🔄 Position limit safety (planned)
3. 🔄 Order idempotency (planned)

**Example Template:**
```python
from z3 import Real, Solver, sat, unsat

def prove_property():
    solver = Solver()

    # Define variables
    x = Real('x')
    y = Real('y')

    # Add constraints (system rules)
    solver.add(x >= 0)
    solver.add(y >= 0)

    # Add negation of property to prove
    # (if UNSAT, property holds)
    solver.add(x + y < 0)  # Try to find counterexample

    status = solver.check()
    assert status == unsat, "Property violated!"
```

---

### Model Checking

**Tool:** TLA+ (planned)

**Target Properties:**
- Liveness: All orders eventually reach terminal state
- Safety: No double-spending of capital
- Fairness: Order queue processing is fair

**Status:** 🔄 Planned for Q1 2026

---

## Formal Specification Languages

### Contracts (Python)
Design-by-contract using:
- Type hints (PEP 484)
- Assertions for invariants
- Docstring contracts (pre/post-conditions)

**Example:**
```python
def transfer_funds(
    from_account: Account,
    to_account: Account,
    amount: Decimal
) -> None:
    """
    Transfer funds between accounts.

    Pre-conditions:
        - amount > 0
        - from_account.balance >= amount
        - from_account != to_account

    Post-conditions:
        - from_account.balance_after == from_account.balance_before - amount
        - to_account.balance_after == to_account.balance_before + amount
        - total_balance unchanged (conservation)

    Invariants:
        - No negative balances
        - Atomic operation (all-or-nothing)
    """
    assert amount > 0, "Amount must be positive"
    assert from_account.balance >= amount, "Insufficient funds"
    assert from_account != to_account, "Cannot transfer to self"

    # Implementation...

    # Verify post-conditions
    assert from_account.balance >= 0, "Negative balance violated"
    assert to_account.balance >= 0, "Negative balance violated"
```

---

### Temporal Logic (TLA+)
For distributed system properties (planned).

**Example Spec:**
```tla
VARIABLES orderQueue, orderStatus

Init ==
    /\ orderQueue = <<>>
    /\ orderStatus = [o \in Order |-> "pending"]

ProcessOrder ==
    /\ orderQueue # <<>>
    /\ LET order == Head(orderQueue) IN
        /\ orderStatus' = [orderStatus EXCEPT ![order] = "processed"]
        /\ orderQueue' = Tail(orderQueue)

Spec == Init /\ [][ProcessOrder]_<<orderQueue, orderStatus>>

Liveness == \A o \in Order: orderStatus[o] = "pending" ~> orderStatus[o] = "processed"
```

---

## Continuous Verification

### CI Integration

All formal verification runs in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Formal Verification

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Z3
        run: pip install z3-solver

      - name: Run Invariant Proofs
        run: python formal/proof_invariant.py

      - name: Type Check
        run: mypy tradepulse/

      - name: Property Tests
        run: pytest tests/property/ --hypothesis-seed=0
```

**Status:** 🔄 Partially implemented

---

## Certification and Compliance

### Proof Certificates

All verified properties generate certificates stored in `formal/`:
- `INVARIANT_CERT.txt` - Free energy boundedness
- (More to be added)

**Format:**
```
Property: <property_name>
Solver status: unsat
Parameters: <key_params>
Result: UNSAT – no counterexample exists
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Audit Trail

Formal verification results tracked in:
- Certificate files (version controlled)
- CI/CD logs (retained 90 days)
- Release notes (permanent record)

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Specify Before Implementing
Write formal specs (contracts, properties) before code.

### 2. Test at Multiple Levels
- Unit tests: Implementation correctness
- Property tests: Invariant satisfaction
- Formal proofs: Mathematical guarantees

### 3. Keep Specs and Code in Sync
Update specs when requirements change. Treat spec violations as bugs.

### 4. Use Appropriate Tools
- Simple properties: Assertions + unit tests
- Complex invariants: Property-based testing
- Critical safety: Formal proofs (SMT, model checking)

### 5. Document Assumptions
All formal methods rely on assumptions. Document them clearly.

**Example:**
```python
"""
Assumptions for position limit proof:
1. Position updates are atomic (no race conditions)
2. Network delays < 1 second (no stale data)
3. Position tracking is eventually consistent (within 100ms)
"""
```

*Formal methods are not a silver bullet, but they provide strong guarantees where traditional testing cannot. Use them judiciously for critical system properties.*
