# TradePulse UI Logical Structure

## Overview
The TradePulse interface prioritizes rapid navigation between high-impact workflows: configuring the trading environment, reviewing recent activity, and diving into actionable analytics. The following logical structure organizes the UI into predictable zones so that users can move fluidly between these tasks without losing context.

## Global Framework
- **Primary Navigation Bar (Top)**
  - **Logo & Workspace Selector**: Grants quick switching between trading workspaces or accounts.
  - **Global Search**: Indexed search across instruments, strategies, and historical records.
  - **Notifications & Alerts**: Consolidated feed for trade confirmations, risk alerts, and system messages.
  - **User Menu**: Contains profile management, session controls, and contextual help.
- **Contextual Breadcrumbs (Below Navigation)**: Reflect the current location and allow a one-click return to higher-level pages.
- **Persistent Utility Rail (Right Edge)**: Hosts cross-cutting utilities such as chat with support, AI assistant insights, and quick toggles for dark mode or reduced motion.

## Home Dashboard Layout
- **Hero Summary Strip (Full width)**: Key account metrics (equity, PnL, margin status) with alert badges when thresholds are breached.
- **Three Core Panels (Equal prominence)**:
  1. **Quick Settings Access**: Summarizes critical configuration values (risk limits, execution venues, automation status) with deep links to the settings workspace.
  2. **Recent Trade History Snapshot**: Displays latest fills, pending orders, and performance deltas with filters for desk, strategy, or instrument.
  3. **Analytics Highlights**: Surface trending KPIs, anomaly alerts, and benchmark comparisons. Cards provide drill-down entry points to full analytics.
- **Activity Timeline (Lower section)**: Chronological feed of configuration changes, trade events, and analytics-generated insights for auditability.

## Settings Workspace
- **Sidebar Navigation (Left)**: Group settings into logical clusters—*Account & Connectivity*, *Risk Controls*, *Automation & Strategies*, *Notifications*, and *Integrations*.
- **Workspace Canvas (Right)**:
  - **Section Header** with quick actions (e.g., "Reset to Defaults", "Export Config").
  - **Tabbed Subsections** for deep configuration (e.g., per-strategy overrides, execution profiles).
  - **Inline Validation & Dependency Indicators**: Reveal relationships between settings (e.g., risk limits tied to account leverage) and surface warnings before saving.
- **Change Review Drawer (Bottom)**: Tracks unsaved modifications, supports comparisons against previous snapshots, and provides approval workflows for regulated environments.

## Trade History Workspace
- **Filter Ribbon (Top)**: Time range presets, instrument selectors, strategy tags, and custom query builder.
- **Data View Toggle**: Switch between *Table*, *Timeline*, and *Heatmap* representations of trade history.
- **Main Content Area**:
  - **Table View**: Paginated with frozen key columns (timestamp, instrument, side) and contextual tooltips for fees, slippage, and execution venue.
  - **Timeline View**: Visual sequence of trades overlaid with market events to support forensic analysis.
  - **Heatmap View**: Performance by instrument, exchange, or strategy with drill-down capability.
- **Detail Drawer (Right)**: Expands on selected trade entries showing order lifecycle, counterparty, audit trail, and related analytics.
- **Export & Compliance Toolbar (Bottom)**: One-click exports to CSV/Excel, API sync, and compliance attestation logging.

## Analytics Workspace
- **KPI Overview Grid (Top)**: Modular cards for win rate, Sharpe, drawdown, latency, and custom metrics. Each card highlights trend direction and thresholds.
- **Segmented Navigation (Secondary Tabs)**: *Portfolio*, *Strategy*, *Market Conditions*, *Risk*, and *Execution Quality*.
- **Interactive Canvas**:
  - Supports slice-and-dice with pivot controls, cohort filters, and scenario overlays.
  - Charts include synchronized crosshairs, annotations, and bookmarking of key states for sharing.
- **Insight Feed (Right)**: AI-generated narratives, hypothesis suggestions, and watchlist alerts with the ability to promote insights into tasks or playbooks.
- **Collaboration Bar (Bottom)**: Shared notes, snapshot sharing, and integration hooks to ticketing tools.

## Cross-Workspace Enhancements
- **Unified Command Palette**: Keyboard-driven access to settings toggles, historical queries, and analytics dashboards.
- **State Preservation**: Remember last-used filters, active tabs, and expanded panels across sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts that collapse sidebars into drawers and reorganize panels for tablets and high-density trading displays.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance with screen reader-friendly labeling, focus management, and adjustable contrast modes.

## Information Architecture Summary
1. **Global navigation** keeps settings, history, and analytics one click away at all times.
2. **Workspace-specific layouts** optimize the primary tasks within each domain while preserving context.
3. **Persistent utilities and contextual drawers** offer deep detail without forcing full page transitions.
4. **Cross-cutting enhancements** ensure a cohesive experience for power users and compliance-driven workflows.

This logical structure balances rapid operational control with rich analytical depth, ensuring traders and risk teams can configure, monitor, and optimize their strategies without friction.
