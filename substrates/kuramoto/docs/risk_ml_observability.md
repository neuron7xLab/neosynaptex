# Risk, Signals, and Observability Control Blueprint

This blueprint consolidates the safeguards required to keep TradePulse's live
trading stack defensible under volatile market regimes. It groups controls across
risk management, machine-learning signal governance, online monitoring, and
observability so that engineering, quant, and SRE teams can execute a coordinated
rollout.

## 1. Portfolio and Position Risk Controls

| Control | Description | Implementation Notes | Success Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Value at Risk (VaR) / Conditional VaR (CVaR)** | Daily and intraday VaR/CVaR estimates for each strategy and at the consolidated book level. | Use historical simulation with rolling 250-day window and Cornish-Fisher adjustment for fat tails. Schedule recomputation every 15 minutes; expose Prometheus gauges (`tradepulse_var_usd`, `tradepulse_cvar_usd`). | VaR exceedances ≤ Basel traffic-light thresholds; alert if realized loss > 0.75 × CVaR. |
| **Kelly Fraction Cap** | Bound leverage and bet sizing by a configurable Kelly fraction (default 0.4). | Compute Kelly using forecast edge and payoff ratios; clamp allocations via `min(forecast_kelly, kelly_cap)`. Store per-strategy cap in `configs/risk/kelly.yaml`. | No positions exceed configured cap; on breach, orders are automatically resized. |
| **Max Drawdown Guard** | Halt risk-on activity when realized drawdown breaches limits. | Track rolling 30/90-day drawdown via equity curve; add Prometheus counter `tradepulse_drawdown_halts_total`. Integrate with risk service to trigger kill-switch (see below). | Drawdown recoveries occur within policy window; zero trades bypass halt state. |
| **Stop Schemas** | Enforce standardized stop-loss/playbook templates (volatility, time, trailing). | Provide schema definitions in `configs/risk/stops.yaml`; ensure execution engine attaches schema metadata to orders for auditability. | 100% of live orders reference an approved stop schema ID. |
| **Correlation & Concentration Limits** | Prevent overexposure to correlated symbols and single-asset concentration. | Maintain rolling correlation matrix from market data service; enforce `max_pairwise_corr` and `max_symbol_weight` thresholds per portfolio. Publish metrics `tradepulse_corr_limit_hits_total`. | Correlation breaches resolved < 5 minutes; concentration per symbol < policy cap. |
| **Kill-Switch & Flat Degradation** | Safety brake that squares positions and rejects new risk when triggered. | Implement manual trigger (CLI/API) and automatic trigger tied to drawdown, VaR breach, or monitoring alerts. Execution service should submit market-close orders and confirm flat via reconciliation. | Kill-switch activation to flat state < 120 seconds; automated notification to incident channel. |

### Operational Playbooks

1. **Intraday Risk Review** – Every hour, review VaR/CVaR dashboards, correlation
   heatmaps, and Kelly utilization. Document overrides in the risk journal.
2. **Drawdown Escalation** – If drawdown > 70% of limit, notify Head of Trading
   and place platform in "warm" state (reduced position sizes) pending analysis.
3. **Kill-Switch Drills** – Quarterly failover exercises to validate "flat" mode
   by simulating exchange outages and verifying reconciliation scripts.

## 2. Signal Engineering Pipeline

| Stage | Guardrails | Tooling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Feature Ingestion** | Enforce schema validation (`pydantic`) and timestamp monotonicity. Version features in `data/features/<feature_set>/<version>` with metadata manifest. | Automated CI job `make validate-features` to run schema + freshness checks. |
| **Labeling (Triple-Barrier)** | Implement López de Prado triple-barrier labeling with configurable horizons (time, profit target, stop). Persist barrier parameters for reproducibility. | `libs/signals/labeling.py` supplies reusable function; store configs under `configs/signals/barriers.yaml`. |
| **Cross-Validation** | Walk-forward cross-validation with purging/embargo to remove leakage. Support combinatorial CV for regime-specific models. | Extend `backtest/cv.py` to produce fold manifests; log coverage via MLflow. |
| **Leakage Guards** | Validate no future data leakage via feature-lag audit, lookahead tests, and embargo enforcement. Add CI assertions that training features precede labels by ≥ 1 bar. | `tests/leakage/test_feature_lag.py` with property-based cases; integrate in `pytest` suite. |
| **Model Registry Integration** | Store trained models with metadata (feature set hash, label config, drift thresholds). | Use existing registry in `core/registry` or extend to include drift baseline statistics. |
| **Feature Signature Compatibility** | Enforce forward/backward compatibility across feature sets and serving schemas. | Model registry stores `feature_signature` describing column order, data types, and acceptable nullability ranges. Deploy pipeline blocks promotion when incoming scoring payload signature deviates beyond tolerance (e.g., missing/extra fields, distributional shifts outside guardrails). |

### Pipeline CI/CD Requirements

- `make signals-lint` ensures feature manifests and barrier configs pass validation.
- Training jobs must export cross-validation reports (`reports/signals/<model>/cv.json`).
- Enforce approval workflow for new feature sets via pull request templates referencing leakage tests and labeling configs.

## 3. Online Evaluation and Drift Monitoring

| Component | Responsibilities | Metrics & Alerts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Prediction Monitoring** | Track real-time prediction distribution vs. training baseline. | Population Stability Index (PSI) per feature and per model output; alert when PSI > 0.2 for two consecutive windows. |
| **Performance Monitoring** | Measure realized vs. expected returns and classification metrics (precision/recall for signal direction). | Rolling KS statistic on residuals; alert if KS p-value < 0.01. Maintain Prometheus summaries (`tradepulse_signal_return_residual`). |
| **Drift Dashboard** | Grafana board combining PSI, KS, hit rate, and drawdown overlay. | Auto-annotate with deployment timestamps from model registry. |
| **Automated Rollback** | Triggered when drift + performance breaches occur simultaneously or kill-switch engaged. | Deployment pipeline includes rollback playbook calling `core/models/registry.rollback_to(version)`. Record events in `reports/models/rollback_log.md`. |
| **Model Audit Trail** | Maintain append-only ledger for scoring configs, barrier parameters, and alert acknowledgements. | Use `observability/audit/model_events.jsonl`; review weekly. |
| **Drift Guardrails** | Pair PSI/JS divergence thresholds with feature-signature compatibility checks before scoring. | Streaming job validates that live payloads satisfy registry-stored guardrails; breaches quarantine payloads, raise PagerDuty alerts, and log drift context for retraining triage. |
| **Auto-Requalification** | Automate retraining/validation jobs when drift persists after manual acknowledgement. | Trigger ML pipeline (`make retrain-model MODEL=<id>`) once drift metric stays above tolerance for N windows; require registry update with new baseline stats before re-enabling traffic. |

### Online Evaluation Loop

1. **Ingest Live Metrics** – Export scoring payloads to Kafka topic `signals.monitoring`.
2. **Compute PSI/JS Divergence** – Streaming job calculates drift stats every 15 minutes; write
   to Prometheus via Pushgateway when running off-schedule. JS divergence is reserved
   for dense/continuous features where PSI is less sensitive.
3. **Drift Guard Checkpoint** – Before forwarding payloads to the scoring service,
   validate feature signatures against registry guardrails. On breach, send payloads
   to a quarantine queue and flip the trading stack into "warm" state until resolved.
4. **Alert Routing** – Route drift alerts to on-call quant via PagerDuty with
   runbook link. Escalate to trading desk if combined with drawdown alert.
5. **Rollback or Requalify** – Incident commander checks registry metadata to select
   stable prior model; orchestrate redeploy and confirm metrics revert to baseline.
   If drift persists but performance remains acceptable, schedule auto-requalification
   run and keep quarantine queue under review.

### Trade Halt Channel

- **Automatic Halt** – When drift guardrails or PSI/JS divergence exceed
  "stop-trading" thresholds, execution service receives a signed command from the
  monitoring pipeline to pause new orders and gracefully flatten risk exposure.
- **Manual Override** – Authorized operators may override the halt via secure CLI
  that writes an immutable record to `observability/audit/halt_overrides.jsonl`
  capturing user, reason, and time. Overrides require dual approval within 15
  minutes or the halt reasserts.
- **Audit Trail** – Weekly audit reviews reconcile overrides against incident
  tickets and confirm that auto-halt conditions were addressed before resuming
  normal trading.

### Causal Signal Validation

1. **A/B + CUPED** – Run holdout-based experiments for new signals with CUPED
   variance reduction to detect small effects while controlling for market noise.
   Store CUPED covariates and pre-exposure summaries in `reports/signals/ab/`.
2. **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** – For macro regime shifts or venue changes,
   evaluate signal impact using DiD over relevant pre/post periods and matched
   controls. Document assumptions and balance metrics in the model registry entry.
3. **Placebo Tests** – Apply placebo interventions (e.g., randomized deployment
   dates or non-treated symbols) to ensure observed lifts are causal and not
   driven by drift or exogenous factors.
4. **Stability Selection** – During model development, use stability selection to
   confirm feature robustness across bootstrap samples. Only promote features
   whose inclusion frequency clears policy thresholds.
5. **Temporal SHAP Diagnostics** – Generate time-series SHAP explanations with
   caution: smooth over intraday noise, clip outlier attributions, and compare to
   baseline regimes. Annotate reports with warnings to prevent over-interpretation
   during volatile periods.

## 4. Observability Coverage (Prometheus)

Ensure every pipeline stage and control loop exposes metrics with consistent
labels (`env`, `strategy`, `model_version`, `exchange`).

| Domain | Required Metrics | Implementation Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Ingest** | `tradepulse_ingest_events_total`, `tradepulse_ingest_lag_seconds`, `tradepulse_ingest_errors_total`. | Instrument data connectors; add histogram for lag. |
| **Backtest** | `tradepulse_backtest_duration_seconds`, `tradepulse_backtest_jobs_in_progress`, `tradepulse_backtest_failures_total`. | Wrap CLI/backtest runners with instrumentation decorator. |
| **Execution** | `tradepulse_orders_submitted_total`, `tradepulse_order_latency_seconds`, `tradepulse_execution_errors_total`, `tradepulse_position_notional`. | Extend existing execution service metrics; include label for risk halt state. |
| **Risk Controls** | `tradepulse_var_usd`, `tradepulse_cvar_usd`, `tradepulse_kelly_utilization_ratio`, `tradepulse_drawdown_percent`. | Emit from risk service after each evaluation cycle. |
| **Model Serving** | `tradepulse_signal_latency_seconds`, `tradepulse_scoring_requests_total`, `tradepulse_scoring_failures_total`. | Wrap inference endpoints; add quantiles (p50/p95/p99). |
| **Alerts & Kill-Switch** | `tradepulse_kill_switch_state` (gauge: 0=off,1=warm,2=flat), `tradepulse_kill_switch_events_total`. | Update when kill-switch toggled; attach `reason` label. |

### Observability Operationalization

- Store alert rules in `observability/prometheus/rules/risk_signals.yml` with
  runbook links for each alert.
- `make observability-verify` lints rules and validates recording expressions.
- Grafana dashboards should be versioned under `observability/grafana/dashboards/`
  with JSONNet templates to reduce drift.
- Include synthetic canaries that submit mock trades to validate latency and risk
  metrics every 5 minutes.
