# Dataset Catalog

This catalog provides a single source of truth for datasets powering TradePulse analytics, feature engineering, risk management,
and reporting. It documents business context, ownership, SLAs, quality controls, lineage, and change processes to guarantee that
data products remain discoverable, trustworthy, and auditable across their lifecycle.

## Governance & Stewardship

- **Dataset Steward** – Accountable owner responsible for data quality, documentation, and remediation.
- **Data Platform** – Maintains pipelines, storage infrastructure, and schema evolution tooling.
- **Risk & Compliance** – Reviews access controls, regulatory constraints, and retention mandates.
- **Observability** – Operates monitoring for ingestion delays, data drift, and validation failures.

Monthly stewardship council reviews metrics, incidents, and backlog items. Critical datasets undergo quarterly audits aligned
with the Architecture Review Program.

## Change Management & Automation

- Use standard **Data Change Request (DCR)** template capturing motivation, impact analysis, rollout steps, and rollback plan.
- Integrate DCR workflow with Jira; tickets tagged `data-catalog` auto-populate review agenda.
- Automation pipeline `catalog-sync.yml` (shared with feature catalog) harvests metadata from schema registry, manifests, and
  validation reports to regenerate catalog tables; output reviewed before merge.
- Git pre-commit hook validates YAML metadata completeness and ensures dataset versions increment when schema changes.

## Drift Monitoring & Failure Testing

- **Distribution Drift** – PSI and KS tests between live ingestion and historical baselines; anomalies escalate to `#data-ops`.
- **Freshness** – Checkpoint-lag alerts ensure ingestion delay stays below SLA thresholds.
- **Integrity** – Referential integrity checks across datasets (e.g., orders referencing valid instruments) executed daily.
- **Chaos Exercises** – Quarterly ingestion disruption drills verifying failover pipelines and data replay.

## Deactivation & Archival

- Publish deprecation notice ≥30 days in advance with migration guide.
- Freeze upstream pipelines, ensure downstream consumers have migrated, and lock dataset to read-only mode.
- Archive to immutable storage, update catalog status to `retired`, and capture final validation report.
- Maintain retention schedule per regulatory requirements and document destruction approvals.

## Access & Change Request Workflow

1. Request access via IAM portal referencing dataset name/version; approvals logged with expiry date.
2. Quarterly access recertification performed by Data Governance + Security.
3. Schema or SLA changes require ARB visibility when cross-cutting architectural components are affected.
4. Emergency changes follow expedited process with post-hoc review.

## Usage & Discovery Enablement

- Provide query snippets in `notebooks/data_walkthroughs/`.
- Surface dataset cards in internal portal with filters (domain, SLA, owner, compliance tag).
- Link datasets to features/models in lineage graphs stored under `docs/assets/datasets/lineage/`.
- Embed usage metrics (query volume, top consumers) updated monthly.

These practices ensure TradePulse datasets remain governed, observable, and aligned with the broader architectural review cadence.
