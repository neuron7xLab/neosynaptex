# Performance Testing Program

## Overview

This program establishes the performance-validation lifecycle for TradePulse services. It covers the test portfolio, success metrics, observability, and continuous-improvement workflows required to keep production latency, throughput, and cost within guardrails as demand patterns evolve.

## Workload Profiles

| Profile | Purpose | Load Shape | Success Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Baseline load** | Validate steady-state behavior against business-as-usual traffic. | Replay recorded production traces scaled to the latest weekly peak. | 95th percentile latency within SLA, no sustained resource saturation. |
| **Stress** | Identify breaking points and recovery characteristics. | Incrementally increase concurrent users (step of 10%) until error budget consumed. | Graceful degradation, no data corruption, automated rollback prepared. |
| **Spike** | Confirm auto-scaling and queue absorption for sudden surges. | Ramp from baseline to 3× peak within 2 minutes, hold for 10 minutes, sudden drop to idle. | Scale-out within 90 seconds, queue drain < 5 minutes, no unbounded retries. |
| **Soak** | Detect leaks, slow drifts, and thermal effects. | Run baseline load for 24 hours with diurnal variation replay. | Latency drift < 10%, memory growth < 5%, no rotating restarts triggered. |

## Target Service-Level Objectives

- **Latency**: p50 ≤ 150 ms, p95 ≤ 350 ms, p99 ≤ 700 ms per critical endpoint.
- **Throughput**: Sustain 1.5× current 95th percentile traffic (requests-per-second or messages-per-minute) for 30 minutes without breaching latency SLOs.
- **Error rate**: < 0.1% user-visible errors during baseline and soak runs; < 1% during stress and spike peaks with automated recovery within 5 minutes.
- **Resource saturation**: CPU < 70%, memory < 75%, I/O wait < 20%, GPU utilisation < 85%; flagged when breached for longer than 2 minutes.
- **Cost efficiency**: Keep incremental cost per transaction within ±10% of production baseline during optimized runs.

## Scenario Catalogue

1. **Traffic growth**
   - Weekly linear increase of 15% for 8 weeks with corresponding dataset size expansions.
   - Verify autoscaling policies, connection pools, and cache warming strategies keep request queues under 500 items.
2. **Dependency degradation**
   - Inject 50% latency amplification and 2% error rate into upstream market-data feeds.
   - Validate circuit breakers trip within 3 seconds, retries apply exponential backoff, and bulkheads prevent cascading failures.
3. **Failover and reserve routing**
   - Simulate regional outage by draining 100% of traffic from the primary deployment and reroute to secondary region.
   - Confirm read replicas promote within 60 seconds, feature flags steer traffic, and eventual consistency windows remain < 2 minutes.
4. **Data pipeline backlog**
   - Pause downstream analytics consumer for 30 minutes while maintaining ingest load.
   - Ensure queue depth remains < 80% capacity, and catch-up completes within 45 minutes after resume.

## Automation Workflow

1. **Test definition**
   - Terraform-managed infrastructure templates spin up ephemeral performance environments.
   - Locust or k6 scenarios stored under `bench/` with parameterised ramp-up schedules and seeded datasets.
2. **Execution pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions `perf.yml` workflow triggers nightly baseline and weekly stress runs.
   - Canary-based promotion gates release pipelines; runs block deploy if SLO regressions exceed thresholds.
3. **Data collection**
   - Prometheus scrapes test clusters every 15 seconds; OpenTelemetry exports spans to Tempo for distributed tracing.
   - Custom metrics include queue depth, retry counts, and cache hit ratios to support bottleneck analysis.
4. **Results storage**
   - InfluxDB retains raw metrics for 90 days; aggregated summaries written to S3 (`reports/perf/`).
   - Each run generates Markdown summaries and parquet datasets for statistical review.

## Observability and Alerting

- **Dashboards**: Grafana folders `Performance/Load`, `Performance/Stress`, `Performance/Soak` with golden signals (latency, throughput, saturation, errors) and capacity headroom charts.
- **Thresholds**: Alert rules evaluate rolling 5-minute windows against SLOs; include burn-rate alerts for error budgets (2h and 24h windows).
- **Event correlation**: Use Grafana Loki to join logs with trace IDs and Prometheus annotations; automatic correlation cards highlight coincident infrastructure events (deploys, config changes).
- **Notifications**: PagerDuty for Sev2+ breaches, Slack channel `#perf-ops` for warnings, Jira automation opens investigation tickets with run metadata.

## Post-Run Governance

1. **Automated reports**
   - nbconvert pipeline renders Jupyter notebooks summarising latency histograms, percentile trends, and resource consumption deltas.
   - Attach anomaly detection (Prophet-based) to flag deviations > 3σ from trailing 10-run baseline.
2. **Postmortems**
   - Trigger blameless review when runs breach SLOs or error budget burn exceeds 5%.
   - Template captures timeline, contributing factors, mitigations, and owner follow-ups.
3. **Optimization backlog**
   - Translate findings into performance OKRs, linking Jira issues to cost/benefit estimates.
   - Track mitigation status in `performance-improvements` Kanban with time-to-resolve targets.

## Cost and Optimization Recommendations

- Enable autoscaling policies to scale-to-zero non-peak workers; capture idle cost savings in FinOps dashboards.
- Schedule load tests during reserved-capacity windows to leverage discounted compute blocks.
- Compare instance families quarterly; evaluate ARM-based or spot-capacity fleets for non-critical workloads.
- Deploy query-level caching and tiered storage to lower read amplification during soak runs.
- Instrument feature flags to toggle experimental algorithms, measuring cost per signal improvement.

## Continual Improvement

- Quarterly review of workload assumptions with product and infrastructure teams.
- Refresh test datasets using anonymised production samples to reflect the latest market regimes.
- Version control test configurations; require pull-request reviews with reliability and FinOps sign-off.
- Maintain dependency health checks and rolling chaos experiments to ensure resilience across partner systems.
