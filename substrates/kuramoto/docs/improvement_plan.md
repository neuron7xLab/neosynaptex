# TradePulse Improvement Plan to Reach 9-10/10 Scores

This document converts the proposed enhancements into concrete, actionable steps for each capability facet. Each section lists prioritized initiatives, implementation guidance, and success criteria.

## Architecture & Modularization

1. **Create Architectural Documentation**
   - Produce a C4-style system diagram and module dependency graph using tools such as [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) or `pydeps`.
   - Automate graph generation via a Makefile target (e.g., `make docs-architecture`).
   - Store diagrams under `docs/architecture/` and link them from the main README.
   - _Success metric_: The diagrams are part of CI artefacts and updated every release.

2. **Introduce Pluggable Strategy/Indicator Framework**
   - Define an abstract base class protocol in `core/strategies/base.py` with lifecycle hooks (`initialize`, `handle_tick`, `finalize`).
   - Allow dynamic registration through Python entry points (`pyproject.toml` → `[project.entry-points."tradepulse.plugins"]`).
   - Provide discovery utilities in `core/strategies/loader.py` that load plugins by name and validate versions.
   - _Success metric_: Third parties can ship pip-installable packages that TradePulse can auto-discover without code changes.

3. **Implement API Versioning**
   - Introduce explicit version headers (e.g., `X-TradePulse-Version`) and namespaced routes (`/api/v1/`).
   - Maintain OpenAPI specs per version under `schemas/openapi/`.
   - _Success metric_: Backward compatibility guarantees and deprecation policy documented.

## Developer Experience & Environment

1. **Provide VS Code Dev Container**
   - Add `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` referencing the repo Dockerfile and specifying extensions (Python, Go, YAML).
   - Ensure post-create commands run `make setup` and `pre-commit install`.
   - _Success metric_: Developers can open the repo in VS Code and start coding without manual setup.

2. **Expand Makefile/CLI Scripts**
   - Add targets for `make data-init`, `make codegen`, `make lint-fix`, `make test-all`.
   - Wrap complex flows in `scripts/` (e.g., `scripts/bootstrap_data.py`).
   - _Success metric_: Onboarding instructions reference Make targets only.

3. **One-Click Onboarding Script**
   - Provide a Python-based onboarding command (e.g. `python -m scripts onboard`) that installs dependencies, initializes env vars, seeds sample data, and runs smoke tests.
   - Document usage in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
   - _Success metric_: New hires report setup time under 15 minutes.

## Testing Practices

1. **Raise Coverage for `core` and `libs/utils`**
   - Identify untested modules via `coverage html` reports.
   - Prioritize edge-case unit tests (e.g., invalid order states, latency spikes).
   - Guard reliability-critical modules in CI via
     `python -m tools.coverage.guardrail` and
     `configs/quality/critical_surface.toml`.
   - _Success metric_: Coverage dashboard in CI stays ≥90% across main.

2. **Add End-to-End Scenarios**
   - Build integration fixtures that run ingestion → signal generation → order placement → settlement on sample data.
   - Use docker-compose services for dependent components (e.g., Kafka, Postgres) with ephemeral containers.
   - _Success metric_: A nightly E2E suite validates the full trading loop with success criteria logged.

3. **Maintain a Regression Test Matrix**
   - Document in `tests/TEST_PLAN.md` mapping features to test cases (unit, integration, property-based, resilience).
   - Include sign-off checklist for releases with references to automated jobs.
   - _Success metric_: Every release PR links to the updated matrix.

## Observability

1. **Manage Observability-as-Code**
   - Version control Prometheus alerts (`observability/prometheus/rules/`) and Grafana dashboards (`observability/grafana/dashboards/`).
   - Provide Make targets to lint (`jsonnetfmt`, `grizzly`) and deploy them via CI/CD.
   - _Success metric_: Rollbacks and previews of dashboards via git history.

2. **Implement Health Checks & SLO Alerts**
   - Define SLOs (e.g., 99.5% successful order placement within 200ms).
   - Configure black-box health checks hitting live endpoints and alert rules for error budget burn.
   - _Success metric_: Alert fatigue decreases; incident response time under defined targets.

3. **Document Monitoring Processes**
   - Extend `docs/observability.md` with runbooks (dashboards to check, escalation policy, FAQ).
   - Include diagrams of data flow (metrics, traces, logs).
   - _Success metric_: On-call engineers can resolve incidents using documentation alone.

## FinOps Dashboards & Optimisation Guidance

1. **Ship Cost Governance Dashboards**
   - Build Grafana/Looker boards that attribute CPU minutes, GPU minutes, IO, and storage spend per team, strategy, and environment using the tagging scheme from the chaos cost controls programme.
   - Surface daily and monthly burn rates with anomaly alerts that trigger when variance exceeds ±15% of forecast.
   - _Success metric_: FinOps can trace ≥95% of spend spikes to a specific team/strategy within one business day.

2. **Automate Savings Recommendations**
   - Feed utilisation metrics into heuristics that flag opportunities: promote feature-cache hits, collapse redundant aggregations, and suggest throttling backtests when diminishing returns are detected.
   - Publish weekly "cost optimisation" reports in `reports/finops/recommendations/` and expose a CLI (`tradepulse_cli finops suggestions`) to query live hints.
   - _Success metric_: Quarterly review shows at least three high-impact savings actions implemented from the recommendation feed.

3. **Close the Loop with Alerting**
   - Integrate deviation alerts into PagerDuty/Slack with playbooks instructing teams to enable caches, adjust sampling, or reschedule heavy jobs.
   - Record acknowledgement and remediation steps in `reports/finops/incidents/` for auditing and continuous improvement.
   - _Success metric_: Mean time to mitigate cost overruns drops below 24 hours.

## Security Processes

1. **Ship SBOM with Releases**
   - Use `syft` or `cyclonedx-bom` integrated into the release pipeline (`make release`).
   - Publish SBOM artefacts alongside Docker images and Python wheels.
   - _Success metric_: SBOM attached to every GitHub Release and stored in artifact registry.

2. **Enforce PR Gates on Vulnerabilities**
   - Integrate SAST (e.g., CodeQL) and DAST scanners; configure branch protection to block merges on critical findings.
   - Document triage and exception process in `SECURITY.md`.
   - _Success metric_: No critical findings merged without explicit approval.

3. **Automate Dependency Hygiene**
   - Enable Dependabot for Python, Go, Docker, and GitHub Actions.
   - Add Trivy scans in CI with auto-created issues/PRs for CVEs.
   - _Success metric_: Time-to-remediate critical CVEs < 7 days.

## Execution Engine

1. **Add Property-Based Tests**
   - Use Hypothesis to generate orders and market states; assert invariants (no negative balances, compliance with risk limits).
   - Store generators in `tests/property/`.
   - _Success metric_: Property tests catch edge conditions before production incidents.

2. **Document Advanced Order Handling**
   - Expand `execution/README.md` covering partial fills, cancel/replace flows, throttling.
   - Create issues for missing capabilities with owners and milestones.
   - _Success metric_: Stakeholders know supported scenarios and backlog items.

3. **Functional E2E Tests with Mocks**
   - Mock upstream exchanges using `pytest-httpserver` or custom fixtures.
   - Validate orchestrations (routing, risk checks) while isolating external dependencies.
   - _Success metric_: Tests run in CI without external services yet mimic production workflows.

## Release Safety & Progressive Delivery

1. **Enable Blue/Green and Rolling Deployments**
   - Extend Kubernetes manifests/Helm charts under `deploy/k8s/` with deployment strategies that support blue/green cutovers and controlled rolling rollouts.
   - Wire readiness probes to queue-drain hooks so pods stop receiving traffic only after in-flight work is flushed.
   - _Success metric_: Production releases execute with zero dropped orders and no customer-visible downtime.

2. **Pre-Flight Compatibility Checks**
   - Implement schema and model compatibility validators that run before deployment (e.g., `make release-validate`) and block promotion when backward-incompatible changes are detected.
   - Add a staging dry-run pipeline that replays real market data through the new release and validates metrics/signals before production rollout.
   - _Success metric_: All releases include an attached staging dry-run report showing parity with the previous version.

3. **Operationalise Health Verification**
   - Capture health-check outcomes, queue depth, and drain duration in release notes for accountability.
   - Automate rollback criteria: if health checks fail or queues fail to drain within SLA, trigger an immediate revert.
   - _Success metric_: Release incident rate falls below 1 per quarter with automated rollback coverage.

## Backtest Engine Realism

1. **Support Market Frictions**
   - Extend the backtester to model commissions, slippage, latency, and order book liquidity.
   - Parameterize via scenario configs stored in `backtest/configs/`.
   - _Success metric_: Strategy PnL aligns within agreed tolerance (e.g., ±5%) to production stats.

2. **Add Pathological Market Scenarios**
   - Provide templates for flash crash, gap open, trading halt using historical data slices.
   - Document results in `docs/backtest_scenarios.md` with expected behavior.
   - _Success metric_: Strategies must pass stress scenarios before promotion.

3. **Benchmark Against Real Data**
   - Run comparative tests between historical live execution logs and simulated runs.
   - Report deviations and calibrate parameters iteratively.
   - _Success metric_: Signed-off validation report stored under `reports/backtest_validation/`.

## Data Quality & Golden Datasets

1. **Publish Golden Indicator Datasets**
   - Curate canonical datasets for key indicators and transformations, storing them in `data/golden/` with versioned metadata and documented expected outputs.
   - Guard them with Great Expectations or Pandera suites that assert statistical properties and transformation correctness.
   - _Success metric_: Indicator regressions trigger automated failures before merging.

2. **Automate Regression Comparisons**
   - Create pipelines that compare model outputs against golden baselines on every PR and release, highlighting drift and raising blocking alerts when tolerances are exceeded.
   - Persist diff reports under `reports/data_quality/regressions/` with annotated charts/tables for reviewer insight.
   - _Success metric_: No production deploy occurs without a passing regression comparison report attached.

3. **Embed Expectations into CI/CD**
   - Extend CI workflows to run data quality checks alongside unit tests, publishing artefacts for observability dashboards.
   - Provide a `make data-quality` target for developers to run checks locally before pushing.
   - _Success metric_: Data incidents tied to indicator/feature regressions fall to zero.

## Performance & Parallelism

1. **Introduce Profiling Suite**
   - Add profiling scripts (`scripts/profile_cpu.py`, `scripts/profile_memory.py`) using `cProfile`, `py-spy`, or `memray`.
   - Integrate optional profiling mode into Makefile and document how to interpret flamegraphs.
   - _Success metric_: Regular profiling reports highlighting hotspots.

2. **Measure Latency & Throughput**
   - Implement benchmarking harness using `pytest-benchmark` or `locust` with configuration matrices.
   - Track results per release in `reports/performance/` and monitor regressions in CI.
   - _Success metric_: Performance budgets defined and enforced.

3. **Auto-Tune Worker Pools**
   - For async workloads, add adaptive scaling logic using queue depth metrics.
   - For container deployments, supply Kubernetes HPA or Docker Compose scale configs.
   - _Success metric_: System maintains target latency under varying load automatically.

## Typing & Style

1. **Enforce Strict Typing**
   - Enable `mypy --strict` for prioritized packages; use `py.typed` markers in distributable libs.
   - Document common patterns (TypedDict, Protocols) in `docs/typing.md`.
   - _Success metric_: CI fails on missing annotations or dynamic typing regressions.

2. **Require Public API Type Hints**
   - Add lint rule via `ruff` or custom checker ensuring exported functions/classes are annotated.
   - Provide templates in CONTRIBUTING for docstrings + type hints.
   - _Success metric_: API docs auto-generated from type hints using `sphinx-autodoc-typehints`.

3. **Automate Formatting & Linting**
   - Configure pre-commit hooks for `black`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `isort`, `gofmt`.
   - Document how to run `pre-commit run --all-files` locally.
   - _Success metric_: CI green on formatting without manual intervention.

## Engineering Culture & Activity

1. **Open to External Contributors**
   - Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` section with issue templates, coding standards, review SLAs.
   - Tag `good first issue` and `help wanted` tickets; maintain project board for newcomers.
   - _Success metric_: Increase in unique external contributors per quarter.

2. **Schedule GameDay/Chaos Testing**
   - Define staging chaos experiments (kill pods, inject latency) and capture learnings in postmortems.
   - Automate with tools like `chaos-mesh` or `litmus` integrated into staging pipeline.
   - _Success metric_: Incident response improvements traced to GameDay exercises.

3. **Maintain Changelog & Roadmap**
   - Update `CHANGELOG.md` via automated tooling (`cz bump`, `towncrier`).
   - Publish quarterly roadmap in `docs/roadmap.md` with OKRs and ownership.
   - _Success metric_: Stakeholders reference roadmap for planning and dependencies.
