# Sequence Diagram Package Template

<details>
<summary>How to use this template</summary>

- Store Mermaid/PlantUML sources under `docs/assets/sequence/<name>.mmd`.
- Export rendered diagrams to `docs/assets/sequence/<name>.png` and reference
  both files for traceability.
- Keep interactions scoped to a single use case; large flows should be split.
- Update the metadata block for review ownership and remove this guidance.
