# Documentation Template Catalogue

Use this directory to source, version, and review canonical templates for the
TradePulse documentation system. Each template below ships with inline
instructions wrapped in a `<details>` block so authors can remove the guidance
once the document is instantiated. Templates reflect the requirements defined in
the Documentation Governance and Standardisation playbooks.

To introduce a new template, add a file to this directory following the same
pattern: metadata block, guidance `<details>` section, and the copy-paste ready
skeleton. Update this catalogue table and cross-link from the documentation
standardisation playbook.
