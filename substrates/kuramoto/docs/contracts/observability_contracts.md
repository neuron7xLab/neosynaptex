# TradePulse Observability Contracts

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Active  
**Scope:** Logging, metrics, tracing, and alerting signals.

## Purpose

Formalize observability signals with strict input/output definitions, SLAs, error models, and versioning for reliable telemetry pipelines.

## Contract Matrix

| Contract | Primary Interface | Scope | Criticality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Logging | `observability/` | Structured logs | P0 |
| Metrics | `monitoring/` | Metrics emission | P0 |
| Tracing | `observability/` | Distributed tracing | P1 |
| Alerting | `monitoring/` | SLO/SLA alerts | P0 |

## 1. Logging Contract
