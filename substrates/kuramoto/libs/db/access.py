"""Generic data access layer for relational databases.

This module provides a small abstraction for executing SQL queries in a
transactionally safe manner.  The :class:`DataAccessLayer` class accepts a
callable that yields raw database connections (for example a psycopg
connection factory) and exposes a higher level API for common operations.  The
goals of the abstraction are the following:

* ensure every connection is properly closed after use;
* automatically commit on success and roll back on failure when mutating
  queries are executed;
* provide thin helper methods for fetching single rows or full result sets
  without leaking cursor management to the callers.

The implementation intentionally stays minimal so that it can operate with any
DB-API 2.0 compatible driver.
