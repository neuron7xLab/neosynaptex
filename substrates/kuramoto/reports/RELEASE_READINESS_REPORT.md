## 4. Cleanup Status

### 4.1 Artifact Scan Results ✅

**Cache Directories Found:** 229  
All properly gitignored:
- `__pycache__/` directories
- `.pytest_cache/`
- `.mypy_cache/`
- `.ruff_cache/`
- `node_modules/`
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`

**Temporary Files Found:** 1  
- `misanthropic_agent.log` (properly gitignored by `*.log` rule)

**Build Artifacts:** None found in repository ✅

**Status:** ✅ CLEAN - All artifacts properly excluded by .gitignore

### 4.2 .gitignore Verification ✅

The repository's `.gitignore` is comprehensive and properly configured:
- Python artifacts: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.egg-info/`, `dist/`, `build/`
- Testing artifacts: `.pytest_cache/`, `htmlcov/`, `coverage.xml`, `reports/`
- IDE files: `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `*.swp`
- OS files: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`
- Logs and temp files: `*.log`, `*.tmp`, `*.bak`, `*.old`
- Node.js: `node_modules/`, `.next/`
- Rust: `target/`

**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT - No cleanup needed, .gitignore working perfectly

### 4.3 Safe Deletion Summary

**Files Deleted:** 0  
**Reason:** Repository is already clean. All temporary artifacts are properly gitignored and not tracked by git.

**Archive Candidates:** 0  
**Reason:** No obvious legacy code requiring archival at this time. Experimental features (hydrobrain_v2/, rl/) are clearly marked as such in documentation and serve research purposes, so they are kept active rather than archived.

## 7. Known Limitations & TODOs

### 7.1 Beta Limitations ⚠️

1. **Live Trading:** In active development, test thoroughly in paper mode before production
2. **Web Dashboard:** In alpha stage, limited functionality
3. **Coverage Gap:** Overall 67% vs target 98% (critical paths covered at 93%+)
4. **Style Issues:** 252 flake8 violations (all non-critical)

### 7.2 Experimental Features 🧪

The following features are marked as experimental:
- Advanced neural trading components (`hydrobrain_v2/`, `rl/`)
- Some geometric indicators require optional dependencies
- Multi-phase regime detection (proven but under refinement)

### 7.3 Post-Release TODOs

**v0.2.0 Roadmap:**
1. Increase test coverage to 98% target
2. Complete web dashboard functionality
3. Address flake8 style violations with automated formatter
4. Pin pytest to 8.x to resolve dependency warnings
5. Fix test import issues (e.g., test_polygon.py)
6. Stabilize live trading for production use
7. Add more exchange integrations

**Infrastructure:**
1. Install golangci-lint in CI environment
2. Consider adjusting synthetic slippage budgets (5.0 → 6.5 bps)
3. Enable mutation testing in nightly CI
