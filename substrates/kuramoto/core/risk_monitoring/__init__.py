"""Risk Monitoring and Mitigation Framework for Autonomous Trading.

This module provides a comprehensive risk monitoring framework that includes:

* **Adaptive Risk Thresholds**: Dynamic thresholds that adjust based on market
  volatility, trade volume, and asset-specific behavior.
* **Stress Detection**: Real-time detection using drawdowns, volatility spikes,
  and order book imbalances.
* **Regulatory Compliance**: Support for MiFID II and Dodd-Frank with audit trails.
* **Performance Tracking**: Key metrics including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown,
  and volatility-adjusted returns.
* **Fail-Safe Mechanisms**: Kill-switch and trade halt capabilities.

Example:
    >>> from core.risk_monitoring import RiskMonitoringFramework
    >>> framework = RiskMonitoringFramework()
    >>> assessment = framework.assess_market_conditions(market_state)
    >>> if assessment.stress_level > StressLevel.ELEVATED:
    ...     framework.activate_safe_mode("High volatility detected")
