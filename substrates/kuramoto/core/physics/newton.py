"""Newton's Laws of Motion applied to market dynamics.

Newton's Laws provide a framework for understanding market momentum, forces,
and inertia:

1. First Law (Inertia): Prices tend to maintain their momentum unless acted
   upon by external forces (news, orders, etc.)

2. Second Law (F=ma): Market force equals the rate of change of momentum,
   relating order flow to price acceleration

3. Third Law: For every market action, there's an equal and opposite reaction
   (buy pressure creates sell pressure)
