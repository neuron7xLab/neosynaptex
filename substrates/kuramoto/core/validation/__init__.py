"""Core validation modules for TradePulse system integrity.

This package provides comprehensive validation components built on three foundational
pillars as specified in the architecture:

- **Physics**: Thermodynamic energy constraints and conservation laws
- **Neuroscience**: Neural pathway coherence and signal integrity
- **Mathematical Logic**: Data validation with formal mathematical constraints
- **System Integration**: Unified validation across all domains

These validators ensure the system operates within physically plausible bounds,
maintains neurologically-inspired coherence, and enforces mathematical rigor
across all data transformations.

For more information, see the documentation at https://docs.tradepulse.io/validation
