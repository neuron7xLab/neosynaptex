"""Architecture Integrator for TradePulse.

This module provides centralized coordination and integration of architectural
components across the TradePulse system. The Architecture Integrator serves as
a unified orchestration layer that manages component lifecycles, validates
architectural constraints, and ensures proper integration between subsystems.

Key responsibilities:
- Component registration and discovery
- Dependency graph management and validation
- Configuration consistency across components
- Health check aggregation and monitoring
- Lifecycle coordination (initialization, startup, shutdown)
- Event-driven inter-component communication
- Architecture compliance validation

Example:
    >>> from core.architecture_integrator import ArchitectureIntegrator
    >>> integrator = ArchitectureIntegrator()
    >>> integrator.register_component("data_ingestion", data_service)
    >>> integrator.initialize_all()
    >>> health = integrator.aggregate_health()
