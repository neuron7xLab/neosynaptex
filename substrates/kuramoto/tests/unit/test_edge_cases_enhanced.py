"""Edge case tests for numerical stability in indicators and calculations.

This module validates that indicators and numerical computations handle
edge cases gracefully without producing NaN, Inf, or incorrect results.

Test Coverage:
- Zero variance (constant prices)
- Extreme values (near overflow)
- Minimal data (single/few points)
- Empty datasets
- Negative values (where invalid)
- Division by zero scenarios

These tests complement the main unit tests by focusing specifically on
boundary conditions and numerical edge cases that could cause instability
in production.
