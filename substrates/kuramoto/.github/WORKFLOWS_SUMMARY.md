## Archived Workflows

The following workflows have been deprecated and moved to `.github/workflows/archive/`:

- `merge-guard.yml` - Replaced by `tests.yml` and `pr-release-gate.yml`
- `pr-complexity-analysis.yml` - Replaced by `pr-release-gate.yml`
- `pr-quality-labels.yml` - Replaced by `pr-release-gate.yml`
- `pr-quality-summary.yml` - Replaced by `tests.yml` comments

See `.github/workflows/archive/README.md` for details.

## Workflow Dependencies

```
Pull Request → tests.yml (lint, test, type-check)
            → security-policy-enforcement.yml
            → performance-regression.yml
            → pr-release-gate.yml (quality gates)
            ↓
Main Branch → ci.yml (coverage, mutation testing)
           → security.yml + semgrep.yml
           → build-wheels.yml
           → sbom-generation.yml
           ↓
Release    → publish-python.yml (PyPI)
          → publish-image.yml (GHCR, Docker Hub)
          → slsa-provenance.yml
```

## Best Practices

1. **For PRs**: Ensure `tests.yml` passes before merging
2. **Security**: All security scans must pass (no HIGH/CRITICAL findings)
3. **Coverage**: Full test suite enforces a 98% gate on main/scheduled runs; PR fast gates report coverage but do not enforce it. Keep improving coverage towards the target.
4. **Performance**: Performance regression workflows flag deviations beyond the configured 20% threshold
5. **Mutation Testing**: 90% kill rate required on main branch

## Maintenance

- **Add new workflows**: Follow the naming convention and update this document
- **Deprecate workflows**: Move to `archive/` and update `archive/README.md`
- **Modify triggers**: Consider impact on CI costs and developer experience
- **Regular review**: Quarterly review of workflow efficiency and costs
