"""Estimator Admissibility Trial — Phase 3 P0 measurement-operator gate.

This package answers a single metrological question: is the canonical
γ estimator (Theil–Sen on log–log of K vs C) usable as a *ruler*?

If the ruler is unstable, every downstream null-screen p-value, every
verdict label, every substrate claim built on top of it is structurally
invalid. The trial therefore gates Phase 3: a hypothesis test cannot
be admitted before the operator measuring its statistic has been
admitted.

The trial sweeps a synthetic-data grid (γ_true × N × σ × estimator),
computes 8 per-cell metrics, applies an admissibility rule (A1–A4),
and emits a six-field verdict block. The verdict is data-driven and
appears verbatim in the output JSON; nothing in this package may
soften, curate, or pre-judge a verdict.
